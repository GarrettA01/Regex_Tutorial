## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors have special meaning in regular expressions. They do not match any character. Instead, they match a position before or after characters:

- `^` – The caret anchor matches the beginning of the text.
- `$` – The dollar anchor matches the end of the text.

### Quantifiers

- The quantities `n` and `m` are integer constants.
- Ordinarily, quantifiers are greedy.
- They cause the regular expression engine to match as many occurrences of particular patterns as possible.
- Appending the `?` character to a quantifier makes it lazy.
- It causes the regular expression engine to match as few occurrences as possible.
